# DeepLearning Android Malware

Detecting and Classifying Android Malware using Deep Learning Techniques

## Introduction 
While detecting android malware with Deep Learning and other machine learning techniques seems to be a solved academic problem (Z. Yuan et. al, X. Su et. al, Abdelmonim Naway and Yuancheng LI, Karbab et. al), employing both static and dynamic analysis on the malware, there is little published work using machine learning techniques on network traffic to specifically detect android malware. The CICMalAnal2017 dataset is one of the only datasets containing real, up-to-date network traffic from malicious and benign android applications. The goal of this project is to employ deep learning techniques, in conjunction with the CICMalAnal2017 dataset, to accurately identify the intent of a given application through collected network traffic data.

## Dataset Summary
### How to Download
The dataset used for this project is described by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity at the University of New Brunswick [here](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html). The link at the bottom of the description of their site can be used to download the dataset. Additionally, the provided `dl-data.sh` script may be used (however the link used needs occasional updating. The script works as of May 2020).  

Since this is a significant dataset (roughly 300 MB zipped), the download takes a while. Go enjoy a coffee while you wait.  

### Data Cleanup
As described in Arash et. al, only nine attributes of the provided 80+ are used to achieve high-accuracy in simpler machine learning algorithms. For computational and temporal simplicity, only these nine attributes are kept for the analysis conducted here.  Below are listed the nine attributes from the paper matched to the attribute name in the dataset:

1) Maximum flow packet length (Flow IAT Max)
2) Minimum flow packet length (Flow IAT Min)
3) Backward variance data bytes (Bwd Packet Length Std)\* 
4) Flow FIN F 17 (FIN Flag Count)
5) Flow forward bytes (Fwd IAT Total)
6) Flow backward bytes (Bwd IAT Total)
7) Maximum Idle (Idle Max)
8) Initial window forward (Init_Win_bytes_forward)
9) Minimum segment size forward (min_seg_size_forward)

\* *(Can't find the variance, so using this instead since it is related)*

Since the analysis is focused on determining the type of traffic (malicious/benign) given a sample, attributes such as IP and Port numbers are dropped from the dataset. There is an obvious use of these in ideas such as black/whitelists, however this is not the contribution of the project. `Nan` values are also dropped if present.

### Binary and Multi-Classification Files
### Dataset Composition
The composition of the dataset is shown in the table below: 

| Type		| Number of Instances	|
